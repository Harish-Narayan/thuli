The saree complements the wearer's tall, slender frame by emphasizing her natural curves, and enhancing her overall grace. The individual is likely attending a traditional Indian wedding in a luxurious setting, like a grand mansion or palace. The dress is a perfect choice for the occasion, as it complements the grandeur and formality of the event.
